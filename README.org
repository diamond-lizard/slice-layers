* Slice Layers
** Description
This script will produce a "slicing" effect on any image made up of two or more different layers.
*** Inspiration
This script was inspired by u/trandoductin's post titled: [[https://old.reddit.com/r/GIMP/comments/itb7as/8_different_images_of_buddha_but_each_image_only/][8 different images of Buddha, but each image only show 1 every 8 columns]]
**** trandoductin's [[https://old.reddit.com/r/GIMP/comments/itb7as/8_different_images_of_buddha_but_each_image_only/g5dwy9v/][instructions for generating the image were]]:
***** 1 - load 8 images as layers
***** 2 - Add layer mask and alpha channel to them (the top 7 layers).
***** 3 - on separate image, 8x8 pixel
****** 3a - make it all black then draw a white line on 2nd column pixels
****** 3b - copy all to have it in the pattern window
****** 3c - then on 2nd layer of 8 layer image select the mask drag copied pattern onto image to fill the layer mask with the 8x8 pattern with 2nd column as white.
***** 4 - repeat step 3 for other layers drawing a different white column each time.
*** Alternatives
G'MIC 2.9.0_pre has a new filter under Sequences / MoirÃ© Animation which is supposed to do something similar
** Installation
*** 1
Copy the "slice-layers.scm" file to $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/GIMP/2.10/scripts or an alternate location (chosen via Preferences -> Folders -> Scripts)
*** 2
Filters -> Script-Fu -> Refresh Scripts
** Use
*** 1 - Load different images in to two or more layers
*** 2 - Click on any layer in the Layers tab
*** 3 - Run the script from: Filters -> Artistic -> Slice Layers
*** 4 - Set the script's parameters to your taste in the dialog that appears.
*** 5 - Click "OK" to generate the sliced image
** User-configurable parameters
*** Vertical or horizontal slices?
Choose whether to slice the image vertically or horizontally.
*** Slice width in pixels
How wide you want each slice to be
**** If you have selected vertical slices:
This slice width will be horizontal (on the X axis, or along the image width)
The slice width for vertical slices can not exceed the layer width.
**** If you have selected horizontal slices:
This slice width will be vertical (on the Y axis, or along the image height)
The slice width for horizontal slices can not exceed the layer height.
** Testing:
This script was only tested on GIMP 2.10.8 on amd64 Gentoo Linux
** FAQ
*** Why might the Slice Layers script be grayed out in the Artistic Filters menu?
**** Make sure you have one layer selected by clicking on any layer in the Layers tab.
Then try running the script again.
**** Your image may not be in RGB mode.
Convert it to RGB using Image -> Mode -> RGB
Then try running the script again.
*** The script does not seem to have any effect
If you have only one layer or each layer in your image is the same, you won't see an effect.
You must have two or more layers in your image, and each layer must be different.
